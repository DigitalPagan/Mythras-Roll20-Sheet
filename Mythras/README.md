This is the generic Mythras sheet intended for use with core Mythras and custom settings.  On final release there will be a number of different sheets for various settings but this one should be able to support any setting required.  Check the campaign options to enable/disable various options as needed.

It is currently in beta testing and only the base character sheet is currently supported.  Importing from MEG, NPCs, Spirits, Battle Units, etc will be added as additional milestones are met.  You may begin testing this sheet if you have a Pro subscription by following the steps below:
* Create a new game in Roll20
* For character sheet select `custom`
* Fill in other details as desired and click `Creat Game`
* In the game details page click `Settings -> Game Settings`
* Ensure `Legacy Sanitization` is NOT checked
* Copy and paste the contents of [Mythras.min.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigitalPagan/Mythras-Roll20-Sheet/v3-beta/Mythras/Mythras.min.html) into `HTML Layout`
* Copy and paste the contents of [Mythras.min.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigitalPagan/Mythras-Roll20-Sheet/v3-beta/Mythras/Mythras.min.css) into `CSS Styling`
* Copy and paste the contents of [translation.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigitalPagan/Mythras-Roll20-Sheet/v3-beta/Mythras/translation.json) into `Translation`
* Click `Save Changes`
* Launch the game and enjoy the sheet

The new sheet will start with a help screen open by default.  Make sure to read the content there to understand some typical patterns used in the new sheet, how to adjust sheet/campaign settings, use the edit mode toggle and hide the help screen when done.

Enjoy.
